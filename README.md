# AI-Powered Chatbot with Pyrogram

This repository contains code for an AI-powered chatbot implemented using Python and Pyrogram. The chatbot uses the GPT-3.5 architecture to provide assistance and engage in conversation with users. It allows users to chat with the bot and get responses generated by the AI model.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-chatbot.git
cd ai-powered-chatbot
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up API credentials:
Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API credentials:
```bash
API_ID = YOUR_API_ID
API_HASH = "YOUR_API_HASH"
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```
4. Run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

Once the bot is up and running, you can start chatting with it by sending messages to your bot's username in Telegram.

## Commands
The bot supports the following commands:
```bash
start: Start the bot and receive a welcome message.
chat: Chat with the bot. Type /chat followed by your message to initiate the conversation.
ping: Get the bot's response time (ping) and current uptime.
info: Get information about the bot, such as version, purpose, and creator.
alive: Check if the bot is alive and get some basic system information.
```

## Note
Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed before running the bot.
Replace the placeholders for API_ID, API_HASH, and BOT_TOKEN with your actual credentials from the Telegram API.
This implementation uses the GPT-3.5 architecture for natural language processing. Make sure you have access to an appropriate API or model for the /chat command to work properly.
